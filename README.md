#bellum populorum
# war of the tribes

Bellum populorum (war of the tribes/peoples) is an opensource software project made for school. It aims to simulate a dynamic process - in this case the development and competition of different ancient peoples. On a (pseudo-)randomly generated map the peoples are generated and then gather resources and food to grow and to gain supremacy. A simulation might end when there is either no opponent or no space/food left. The peoples will have slight differences in behavior and their ability to handle the situation they are facing.

## planned features
<p>
<ul>
<li>Three different peoples</li>
<li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
<li>Randomly generated maps</li>
<li>Support for multiple (simultaneous) simulations</li>
<li>Great 8-Bit graphics (like good old times on Amiga ;))</li>
<li>Tools to manipulate the simulation in some ways</li>
<li>statistics</li>
</ul>

## peoples
There will be 3 different peoples. Their behavior and abilities might not be final, the list might get extended later. Here are just some thoughts to make the simulation a bit more interesting:

### Romans
Romans are well organized and highly developed. They are very well trained and because of that have a strong army. But quality does not often come cheap.

### Slavonics
In contrast to the Romans the Slavonics don't have a really strong army or sophisticated equipment. But they are able to outnumber their opponents. They grow fast and stick together.

### Germans
The Germans will have both bonuses that Romans and Slavonics have. They are not as well equipped as Romans and not as many as the Slavonics.
