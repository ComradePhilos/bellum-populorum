#bellum populorum
## war of the tribes

Bellum populorum is a open source software created as a school project to simulate the expansion of tribes under certain circumstances and the war that will grow between them. It could be unterstood as a "The Settlers"-Game, but just for watching.

It will be available for Linux and Windows.
